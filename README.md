# EO-IR-Video-Classification-System
This project features a real-time Electro-Optical (EO) / Infrared (IR) video classification system designed to identify and categorize military entities. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning, the system processes dual-spectrum video feeds to provide high-accuracy detection and classification through a custom-built user interface.
